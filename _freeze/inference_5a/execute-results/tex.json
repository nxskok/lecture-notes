We ask 20 males and 20 females whether they\neach agree with having DST all year round (\"yes\") or not (\"no\"). Some\nrandomly chosen rows of data:\n\n\\footnotesize\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmy_url <- \"http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/dst.txt\"\ndst <- read_delim(my_url,\" \")\ndst %>% slice_sample(n = 8)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 8 x 2\n  gender agree\n  <chr>  <chr>\n1 male   yes  \n2 female yes  \n3 male   no   \n4 male   yes  \n5 female yes  \n6 female no   \n7 male   yes  \n8 male   yes  \n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\\normalsize\n\n## ... continued\n\nCount up individuals in each category combination, and arrange in\ncontingency table:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntab <- with(dst, table(gender, agree))\ntab\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n        agree\ngender   no yes\n  female 11   9\n  male    3  17\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n-   Most of the males say \"yes\", but the females are about evenly split.\n-   Looks like males more likely to say \"yes\", ie. an association\n    between gender and agreement.\n-   Test an $H_0$ of \"no association\" (\"independence\") vs. alternative\n    that there is really some association.\n-   Done with `chisq.test`.\n\n## ...And finally\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nchisq.test(tab, correct=FALSE)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n\n\tPearson's Chi-squared test\n\ndata:  tab\nX-squared = 7.033, df = 1, p-value = 0.008002\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n-   Reject null hypothesis of no association (P-value 0.008)\n-   therefore there is a difference in rates of agreement between (all)\n    males and females (or that gender and agreement are associated).\n-   This calculation gives same answers as you would get by hand.\n    (Omitting `correct = FALSE` uses \"Yates correction\".\n\n## Mood's median test\n\n-   Earlier: compare medians of two groups.\n-   Sign test: count number of values above and below something (there,\n    hypothesized median).\n-   Mood's median test:\n    -   Find \"grand median\" of all the data, regardless of group\n    -   Count data values in each group above/below grand median.\n    -   Make contingency table of group vs. above/below.\n    -   Test for association.\n-   If group medians equal, each group should have about half its\n    observations above/below grand median. If not, one group will be\n    mostly above grand median and other below.\n\n## Mood's median test for reading data\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\n-   Find overall median score:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nkids %>% summarize(med=median(score)) %>% pull(med) -> m\nm\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 47\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n-   Make table of above/below vs. group:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntab <- with(kids, table(group, score > m))\ntab\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n     \ngroup FALSE TRUE\n    c    15    8\n    t     7   14\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n-   Treatment group scores mostly above median, control group scores\n    mostly below, as expected.\n\n## The test\n\n-   Do chi-squared test:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nchisq.test(tab, correct=FALSE)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n\n\tPearson's Chi-squared test\n\ndata:  tab\nX-squared = 4.4638, df = 1, p-value = 0.03462\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n-   This test actually two-sided (tests for any association).\n-   Here want to test that new reading method *better* (one-sided).\n-   Most of treatment children above overall median, so do 1-sided test\n    by halving P-value to get 0.017.\n-   This way too, children do better at learning to read using the new\n    method.\n\n## Or by smmr\n\n-   `median_test` does the whole thing:\n\n\\small \n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmedian_test(kids, score, group)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n$grand_median\n[1] 47\n\n$table\n     above\ngroup above below\n    c     8    15\n    t    14     7\n\n$test\n       what      value\n1 statistic 4.46376812\n2        df 1.00000000\n3   P-value 0.03462105\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\\normalsize\n\n-   P-value again two-sided.\n\n## Comments\n\n-   P-value 0.013 for (1-sided) t-test, 0.017 for (1-sided) Mood median\n    test.\n-   Like the sign test, Mood's median test doesn't use the data very\n    efficiently (only, is each value above or below grand median).\n-   Thus, if we can justify doing *t*-test, we should do it. This is the\n    case here.\n-   The *t*-test will usually give smaller P-value because it uses the\n    data more efficiently.\n-   The time to use Mood's median test is if we are definitely unhappy\n    with the normality assumption (and thus the t-test P-value is not to\n    be trusted).\n\n## A graph\n\n- Two categorical variables (above/below and group), so grouped bar chart\n- `group` is \"explanatory\" and above/below is \"response\".\n- Plot explanatory as `x` and plot response as `fill` (`y` will be frequency):\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nkids %>% \n  mutate(above = (score > m)) %>% \n  ggplot(aes(x = group, fill = above)) + geom_bar(position = \"dodge\") -> g\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n## The graph\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ng\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](inference_5a_files/figure-beamer/unnamed-chunk-3-1.pdf){fig-pos='H'}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n- The significant association is because the treatment group children mostly score above the grand median, and the control group children score mostly below.\n\n",
