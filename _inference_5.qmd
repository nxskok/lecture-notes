## Jumping rats
- Link between exercise and healthy bones (many studies).
- Exercise stresses bones and causes them to get stronger.
- Study (Purdue): effect of jumping on bone density of growing rats.
- 30 rats, randomly assigned to 1 of 3 treatments:
  - No jumping (control)
  - Low-jump treatment (30 cm)
  - High-jump treatment (60 cm)
- 8 weeks, 10 jumps/day, 5 days/week.
- Bone density of rats (mg/cm$^3$) measured at end.
- See whether larger amount of exercise (jumping) went with higher
bone density.
- Random assignment: rats in each group similar in all important ways.
- So entitled to draw conclusions about cause and effect.

## Reading the data
Values separated by spaces:

\small

```{r inference-5-R-9}
my_url <- "http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/jumping.txt"
rats <- read_delim(my_url," ")
```

\normalsize

## The data (some random rows)

\small
```{r inference-5-R-10}
rats %>% slice_sample(n=12)
```
\normalsize

## Boxplots

```{r inference-5-R-11, fig.height=3.7}
ggplot(rats, aes(y=density, x=group)) + geom_boxplot()
```

## Or, arranging groups in data (logical) order

```{r inference-5-R-12, fig.height=3.5}
ggplot(rats, aes(y=density, x=fct_inorder(group))) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

## Analysis of Variance
- Comparing > 2 groups of independent observations (each rat only
does one amount of jumping).
- Standard procedure: analysis of variance (ANOVA).
- Null hypothesis: all groups have same mean.
- Alternative: “not all means the same”, at least one is different from
others.

## Testing: ANOVA in R

```{r inference-5-R-13}
rats.aov <- aov(density~group,data=rats)
summary(rats.aov)
```

- Usual ANOVA table, small P-value: significant result.
- Conclude that the mean bone densities are not all equal.
- Reject null, but not very useful finding.

## Which groups are different from which?
- ANOVA really only answers half our questions: it says “there are
differences”, but doesn’t tell us which groups different.
- One possibility (not the best): compare all possible pairs of groups,
via two-sample t.
- First pick out each group:

```{r inference-5-R-14}
rats %>% filter(group=="Control") -> controls
rats %>% filter(group=="Lowjump") -> lows
rats %>% filter(group=="Highjump") -> highs
```

## Control vs. low

```{r inference-5-R-15}
t.test(controls$density, lows$density)
```

No sig. difference here.

## Control vs. high

```{r inference-5-R-16}
t.test(controls$density, highs$density)
```

These are different.

## Low vs. high

```{r inference-5-R-17}
t.test(lows$density, highs$density)
```

These are different too.

## But...
- We just did 3 tests instead of 1.
- So we have given ourselves 3 chances to reject $H_0:$ all means equal,
instead of 1.
- Thus $\alpha$ for this combined test is not 0.05.

## Honestly Significant Differences
- Compare several groups with one test, telling you which groups differ
from which.
- Idea: if all population means equal, find distribution of highest sample
mean minus lowest sample mean.
- Any means unusually different compared to that declared significantly
different.

## Tukey on rat data

```{r inference-5-R-18, echo=F}
width <- getOption("width")
options(width = 60)
```


\small
```{r inference-5-R-19}
rats.aov <- aov(density~group, data = rats)
TukeyHSD(rats.aov)
```
\normalsize

```{r inference-5-R-20, echo=F}
options(width=width)
```

- Again conclude that bone density for highjump group significantly higher
than for other two groups.

## Why Tukey’s procedure better than all t-tests 
Look at P-values for the two tests:

```
Comparison        Tukey    t-tests
----------------------------------
Highjump-Control 0.0016     0.0021
Lowjump-Control  0.4744     0.2977
Lowjump-Highjump 0.0298     0.0045
```

  
- Tukey P-values (mostly) higher.
- Proper adjustment for doing three t-tests at once, not just one in
isolation.

## Checking assumptions

```{r inference-5-R-21, fig.height=3.5}
ggplot(rats,aes(y = density, x = fct_inorder(group)))+
  geom_boxplot()
```

Assumptions:

- Normally distributed data within each group
- with equal group SDs.

## Normal quantile plots by group

```{r inference-5-R-22, fig.height=3.5}
ggplot(rats, aes(sample = density)) + stat_qq() + 
  stat_qq_line() + facet_wrap( ~ group)
```

## The assumptions
- Normally-distributed data within each group
- Equal group SDs.
- These are shaky here because:
  - control group has outliers
  - highjump group appears to have less spread than others.
- Possible remedies (in general):
  - Transformation of response (usually works best when SD increases
with mean)
  - If normality OK but equal spreads not, can use Welch ANOVA.
(Regular ANOVA like pooled t-test; Welch ANOVA like
Welch-Satterthwaite t-test.)
  - Can also use Mood’s Median Test (see over). This works for any
number of groups.

## Mood’s median test 1/4
- Find median of all bone densities, regardless of group:

\small
```{r inference-5-R-23}
(rats %>% summarize(med = median(density)) %>% pull(med) -> m)
```
\normalsize

- Count up how many observations in each group above or below
overall median:

```{r inference-5-R-24}
tab <- with(rats, table(group, density > m))
tab
```


## Mood’s median test 2/4 

```{r inference-5-R-25}
tab
```


- All Highjump obs above overall median.
- Most Control obs below overall
median.
- Suggests medians differ by group.

## Mood’s median test 3/4 
- Test whether association between group and being above/below
overall median significant using chi-squared test for association:

```{r inference-5-R-26}
chisq.test(tab,correct=F)
```

- Very small P-value says that being above/below overall median
depends on group.
- That is, groups do not all have same median.

## Mood’s median test 4/4 
Or with `median_test` from `smmr`, same as before. 

```{r inference-5-R-27}
median_test(rats,density,group)
```



## Comments
- No doubt that medians differ between groups (not all same). 
- This test is equivalent of $F$-test, not of Tukey. 
- To determine which groups differ from which, can compare all possible
pairs of groups via (2-sample) Mood’s median tests, then adjust
P-values by multiplying by number of 2-sample Mood tests done (Bonferroni):

```{r inference-5-R-28}
pairwise_median_test(rats,density,group)
```

- Now, lowjump-highjump difference no longer significant. 

## Welch ANOVA
- For these data, Mood’s median test probably best because we doubt
both normality and equal spreads.
- When normality OK but spreads differ, Welch ANOVA way to go.
- Welch ANOVA done by `oneway.test` as shown (for illustration):

```{r inference-5-R-29}
oneway.test(density~group,data=rats)
```

- P-value very similar, as expected.
- Appropriate Tukey-equivalent here called Games-Howell.

## Games-Howell

- Lives in package `PMCMRplus`. Install
first.

```{r inference-5-R-30, eval=F}
library(PMCMRplus)
```


```{r games-howell, warning=F}
gamesHowellTest(density~factor(group),data=rats)
```
