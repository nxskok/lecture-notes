## Multivariate analysis of variance

-   Standard ANOVA has just one response variable.

-   What if you have more than one response?

-   Try an ANOVA on each response separately.

-   But might miss some kinds of interesting dependence between the
    responses that distinguish the groups.

## Packages

```{r bManova-1, results='hide', message=FALSE}
library(car) # may need to install first
library(tidyverse)
library(MVTests) # also may need to install
```

## Small example

-   Measure yield and seed weight of plants grown under 2 conditions:
    low and high amounts of fertilizer.

-   Data (fertilizer, yield, seed weight):

```{r bManova-2 }
url <- "http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/manova1.txt"
hilo <- read_delim(url, " ")
```

-   2 responses, yield and seed weight.

## The data

```{r bManova-3 }
hilo
```

## Boxplot for yield for each fertilizer group

```{r ferto,size="small",fig.height=3}
ggplot(hilo, aes(x = fertilizer, y = yield)) + geom_boxplot()
```

Yields overlap for fertilizer groups.

## Boxplot for weight for each fertilizer group

```{r casteldisangro,size="small",fig.height=3}
ggplot(hilo, aes(x = fertilizer, y = weight)) + geom_boxplot()
```

Weights overlap for fertilizer groups.

## ANOVAs for yield and weight

\small

```{r bManova-4 }
hilo.y <- aov(yield ~ fertilizer, data = hilo)
summary(hilo.y)
hilo.w <- aov(weight ~ fertilizer, data = hilo)
summary(hilo.w)
```

\normalsize

Neither response depends significantly on fertilizer. But...

## Plotting both responses at once

-   Have two response variables (not more), so can plot the response
    variables against *each other*, labelling points by which fertilizer
    group they're from.

\footnotesize

-   First, create data frame with points $(31,14)$ and $(38,10)$ (why?
    Later):

```{r bManova-5, size="footnotesize"}
d <- tribble(
  ~line_x, ~line_y,
  31, 14,
  38, 10
)
d
```

-   Then plot data as points, and add line through points in `d`:

```{r bManova-6 }
ggplot(hilo, aes(x = yield, y = weight,
                      colour = fertilizer)) + geom_point() +
  geom_line(data = d,
            aes(x = line_x, y = line_y, colour = NULL)) -> g
```

\normalsize

## The plot

```{r charlecombe, echo=F, fig.height=3}
g
```

## Comments

-   Graph construction:
    -   Joining points in `d` by line.
    -   `geom_line` inherits `colour` from `aes` in `ggplot`.
    -   Data frame `d` has no `fertilizer` (previous `colour`), so have
        to unset.
-   Results:
    -   High-fertilizer plants have both yield and weight high.

    -   True even though no sig difference in yield or weight
        individually.

    -   Drew line separating highs from lows on plot.

## MANOVA finds multivariate differences

-   Is difference found by diagonal line significant? MANOVA finds out.

\footnotesize

```{r bManova-7, echo=FALSE}
options(width = 60)
```

```{r bManova-8}
response <- with(hilo, cbind(yield, weight))
response
hilo.1 <- manova(response ~ fertilizer, data = hilo)
summary(hilo.1)
```

\normalsize

-   Yes! Difference between groups is *diagonally*, not just up/down
    (weight) or left-right (yield). The *yield-weight combination*
    matters.

## Strategy

-   Create new response variable by gluing together columns of
    responses, using `cbind`.

-   Use `manova` with new response, looks like `lm` otherwise.

-   With more than 2 responses, cannot draw graph. What then?

-   If MANOVA test significant, cannot use Tukey. What then?

-   Use *discriminant analysis* (of which more later).

## Another way to do MANOVA

using `Manova` from package `car`:

```{r, include=FALSE}
w <- getOption("width")
options(width = 132)
```

\tiny

```{r bManova-10}
hilo.2.lm <- lm(response ~ fertilizer, data = hilo)
hilo.2 <- Manova(hilo.2.lm)
summary(hilo.2)
```

\normalsize

```{r, include=FALSE}
options(width = w)
```

## Comments

-   Same result as small-m `manova`.

-   `Manova` will also do *repeated measures*, coming up later.

## Assumptions

-   normality of each response variable within each treatment group
    -   this is actually *multivariate* normality, with correlations
-   equal spreads: each response variable has same variances and
    correlations (with other response variables) within each treatment
    group. Here:
    -   yield has same spread for low and high fertilizer
    -   weight has same spread for low and high fertilizer
    -   correlation between yield and weight is same for low and high
        fertilizer
-   test equal spread using Box's $M$ test
    -   a certain amount of unequalness is OK, so only a concern if
        P-value from $M$-test is very small (eg. less than 0.001).

## Assumptions for yield-weight data

For normal quantile plots, need "extra-long" with all the data values in
one column:

```{r}
hilo %>% 
  pivot_longer(-fertilizer, names_to = "xname", 
               values_to = "xvalue") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(sample = xvalue)) + stat_qq() + 
    stat_qq_line() +
    facet_grid(xname ~ fertilizer, scales = "free") -> g
```

There are only four observations per response variable - treatment group
combination, so graphs are not very informative (over):

## The plots

```{r, fig.height=4}
g
```

## Box M test

-   Make sure package `MVTests` loaded first.
-   inputs:
    -   the response matrix (or, equivalently, the response-variable
        columns from your dataframe)
    -   the column with the grouping variable in it (most easily gotten
        with `$`).

```{r}
library(MVTests)
# hilo %>% select(yield, weight) -> numeric_values
summary(BoxM(response, hilo$fertilizer))
```

-   No problem at all with unequal spreads.

## Another example: peanuts

-   Three different varieties of peanuts (mysteriously, 5, 6 and 8)
    planted in two different locations.

-   Three response variables: `y`, `smk` and `w`.

```{r bManova-11, size="footnotesize"}
u <- "http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/peanuts.txt"
peanuts.orig <- read_delim(u, " ")
```

## The data

\small

```{r bManova-12}
peanuts.orig
```

\normalsize

## Setup for analysis

```{r bManova-13 }
peanuts.orig %>%
  mutate(
    location = factor(location),
    variety = factor(variety)
  ) -> peanuts
response <- with(peanuts, cbind(y, smk, w))
head(response)
```

## Analysis (using `Manova`)

```{r, include=FALSE}
w <- getOption("width")
options(width = 100)
```

\tiny

```{r bManova-14}
peanuts.1 <- lm(response ~ location * variety, data = peanuts)
peanuts.2 <- Manova(peanuts.1)
summary(peanuts.2)
```

\normalsize

```{r, include=FALSE}
options(width = w)
```

## Comments

-   Interaction not quite significant, but main effects are.

-   Combined response variable `(y,smk,w)` definitely depends on
    location and on variety

-   Weak dependence of `(y,smk,w)` on the location-variety
    *combination.*

-   Understanding that dependence beyond our scope right now.

## Comments

-   this time there are only six observations per location and four per
    variety, so normality is still difficult to be confident about

-   `y` at location 1 seems to be the worst for normality (long tails /
    outliers), and maybe `y` at location 2 is skewed left, but the
    others are not bad

-   there is some evidence of unequal spread (slopes of lines), but is
    it bad enough to worry about? (Box M-test, over).

## Box's M tests

-   One for location, one for variety:

```{r}
summary(BoxM(response, peanuts$location))
summary(BoxM(response, peanuts$variety))
```

-   Neither of these P-values is low enough to worry about. (Remember,
    the P-value here has to be *really* small to indicate a problem.)
